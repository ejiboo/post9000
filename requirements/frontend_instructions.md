## Project Overview
Build a web application that allows a user to quickly post to a multitude of social media platforms.

## Feature Requirements
- User can login/signup with Google, Apple, Facebook, or email/password
- User can post to a multitude of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Pinterest, LinkedIn, etc.
- User can decide what platforms they want to post to (checkboxes)
- User can preview what their post will look like on each platform
- User can connect their social media accounts to the app to post directly to their accounts
- User can schedule posts to be posted at a later time
- User can view their posts on their profile page
- User can upload Images or Videos, or use a URL for the app to download and post
- User can add information like description, hashtags, location, mentions, etc.
- the application will determine which fields are required for each platform and automatically format them for the destination platform
- User can view the status of their posts (pending, posted, failed)
- User can view the history of their posts
- If connections to social media accounts aren't setup, or the APIs aren't available, the application will present the formatted information in a way that the user can copy and paste into their social media account
- the application will have a minimalistic design and be responsive and easy to use


## To Do
- Research each platform to find out if there is an API we can easily use to allow us to directly post content on their platforms from our web application.
